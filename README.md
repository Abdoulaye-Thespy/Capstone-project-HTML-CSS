# Capstone-project-HTML-CSS
-This is my captestone project on HTML and CSS curriculum in Microverse

## The project is about a record for ARCHEOLOGICAL SITES in Cameroon

## In this particular project, we have three pages: The Home page, the result page and the detail page.

## I the Home page, we can search for a particular ARCHEOLOGICAL SITE that we would like to visit.

## The results of our search  are then shown on the result page, where can directly click on a particular result and be directed to the detail page where we can have much more details about that ARCHEOLOGICAL SITE in particular.

## In the detail page, we will be able to see the schedule and how to acces the ARCHEOLOGICAL SITE and we can book a day to visit if we want.
